CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:336 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindNPUPNP.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "NPUPNP", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "NPUPNP" with any
  of the following names:

    NPUPNPConfig.cmake
    npupnp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "NPUPNP" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "NPUPNP_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "NPUPNP"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
